## Model Tiers
Dispatch is tiered by task shape, never hardcoded to a model name:

- **Extraction tier** — the work-recap scout: search-and-quote work. Use the platform's cheapest capable model when the harness exposes a known override; otherwise inherit.
- **Ceiling tier** — the explainer composition, the check-in reasoning, and the corrections. These run in the main conversation on the orchestrator's model; nothing is dispatched for them.

**Degradation rule.** When the platform's subagent primitive cannot select per-agent models, dispatch scouts on the inherited model and keep their read budgets. When the platform has no subagent primitive at all, run the scout work inline with the same budgets.
